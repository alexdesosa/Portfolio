<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 25 years old male, I started a lot of careers, such as lawyer, translator of english and italian and social worker. I too worked as an assistant in a lawsuit.</p>

<p>My curiosity for programming started when I saw just a simple video in YouTube website where I guy showed how to make an app about the climate, I was fascinating about the whole lines of codes, the codes, everything.
  I asked to myself: "Why not? Why I shouldn't try it?" I knew from the very first moment that I started researching about how to code and what programs I must used, I knew it was difficult but
  I knew that I would love it, I started searching in YouTube tutorials about how to program, looking for project to started and improve myself.

<p>I think from the moment that I wrote this that I will be the best programmer without a doubt.</p>
